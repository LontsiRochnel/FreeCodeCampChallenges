# freeCodeCamp Daily Challenge Solutions

This repository is a personal collection of daily challenge solutions from freeCodeCamp.org. I use it to practice, track progress, and build a searchable library of solutions across HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other front-end topics.

## Purpose

- Store daily solutions and experiments inspired by freeCodeCamp challenges.
- Provide a clean, organized structure to revisit and refine solutions later.
- Share patterns, tips, and small utilities that help with learning web development.

## Repository structure

- `YYYY-MM-DD (Challenge Title).ext` - Daily files following the pattern used in this workspace (e.g., `November-12-2025(Email Signature Generator).js`).
- `assets/` - Optional: images, screenshots, or example inputs used by challenges.
- `README.md` - This file.

## File naming convention

Use a consistent filename format to make browsing and sorting easier. Suggested patterns:

- `YYYY-MM-DD (Challenge Title).ext` — ISO-like date first, then the challenge title in parentheses.
- `YYYY-MM-DD-Challenge-Title.ext` — If you prefer hyphen separation and no parentheses.

Examples:
- `2025-11-12 (Email Signature Generator).js`
- `2025-11-11-Basic-HTML-structure.html`

## How to run / preview

- For plain HTML/CSS/JS files, open the file in a browser or use a local HTTP server (e.g., `npx http-server` or VS Code Live Server).
- For small Node.js scripts, run `node "Filename.js"` from the repo root.

## Contributing / personal workflow

This repo is primarily for personal practice. If you'd like to contribute or suggest improvements:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Add or improve a solution in a clearly named file, or move polished solutions into `solutions/<language>/`.
3. Open a pull request with a short description of the changes.

## Notes and conventions

- Keep each daily challenge self-contained in a single file when possible.
- Add comments at the top of files describing which freeCodeCamp challenge it's solving and any key learning points.
- For exercises with tests, include the test runner or instructions to run them.
